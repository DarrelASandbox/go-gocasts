## Basics

```sh
go
go run main.go
go help packages
```

- <b>Type of packages:</b>
  - <b>Executable:</b> Generates a file that we can run (<i>"main" is special</i>)
  - <b>Reusable:</b> Code used as 'helpers'. Good place to put reusable logic
- <code>package main</code> : Defines a package that can be compiled and then _executed_. <b>Must have a func called 'main'</b>
- <code>package calculator</code> : Defines a package that can be used as a dependency (helper code)
- <code>package uploader:</code> : Defines a package that can be used as a dependency (helper code)
